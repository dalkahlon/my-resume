        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            I am a highly competent self-motivated IT professional with a proven track record in designing and supporting bespoke and commercial enterprise-level applications, databases and data visualisation dashboards.
            <br /> 
            Over my career I have continuously demonstrated not only my ability to carry out the tasks required by my role to the highest standard but to also continuously innovate the IT services offered.
            <br />
            I championed the data migration project during a £1million+ adoption of SAP over a legacy ERP system, helping the team complete the overall implementation in half the allocated time saving considerable costs and resources.
            <br />
            I successfully supervised a team of TCS (Tata Consultancy Services - India) IT service agents supporting various engineering applications used globally.
            <br />
            I have created data visualisation dashboards in ServiceNow, Tableau & Excel and presented these to board-level.
            <br />
            I have championed customer satisfaction within various teams and have gained feedback and introduced new initiatives to improve overall metrics.
            <br />
            I led the full lifecyle development of a bespoke ERP-like application suite of modules covering employee timesheet entry, holiday bookings, works orders, non-conformance reporting, deviations and waivers, business bid development, purchase orders, and document control.
            <br />
            I have led the administration of a Windchill PLM solution holding CAD data and a vast document control system.
            <br />
            I can demonstrate high levels of adaptability and quickly analyse large service projects ensuring high performance management standards and the constant evolution of the services offered.
            <br />
            I have always made significant contributions to ensure projects are delivered on time and on budget and I thrive on the demands of working to the tightest deadlines in complex scenarios.
            <br />
            The diversity of my experience and engineering background has also allowed me to better understand and pre-empt the needs of end-users to build a strong working knowledge of a variety of software, hardware and networking techniques alongside their effective application.
